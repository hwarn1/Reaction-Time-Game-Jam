# Reaction-Time-Game-Jam

### Based on Cliff Gurske's Javaspript Reaction Time Game:
https://codepen.io/cliff538/pen/GRYXqV

### This game tests your reaction time when you click boxes that appear across the screen as quickly as you can.

#### So far it is playable for an unlimited amount of time. When the box is clicked, it disappears and reappears in a different location in a different color 1 second later. When the box is clicked, the time between it appearing and being clicked is calculated and displayed on the screen as "reaction time". The average of all the reaction times is also calculated and displayed each time the box is clicked.

#### Created using object-oriented Javascript, with HTML and CSS. Platform used to construct code was p5.js Web Editor.
